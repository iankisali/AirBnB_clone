## Description

This is a team project that is part of ALX Full-stack Software Engineering Program. It is the first step towards building our first full web application - AirBnB clone. In this repo we are creating the Console which is a Storage Engine i.e a Command Interpreter that can manipulate data without visual interface, like a Shell.
